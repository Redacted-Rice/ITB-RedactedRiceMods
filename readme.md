# Squads
* Treeherders - v3.0.1 - Inspired by ents, this squad focuses on using forests tiles to increase their power. The flagship entborg mech gets stronger as the forests get destroyed
* WorldBuilders - v1.1.1 - This squad focuses on terrain manipulation to block and avoid damage. It has some strong single target effects but you can easily get overwhelmed by numbers if not strategically manipulating the terrain

# Other
* Rebalance Core+ - v1.0.0 - Rebalances core Vanilla Pilot Level Up Skills/Abilities (Grid DEF, +1 Move, +2 Health) to be slighlty better and distinct from Skilled

# Libs
* BoardUtils - v1.1.0 - Library for board related functions and pathing
* PassiveEffect - v1.2.0 - Library to help with adding passive weapons to the game. This will handle automatically detecting if the weapon is powered and only call hooks when it is
* PredictableRandom - v1.1.0 - Library to get random numbers in a way that is repeatable for when undoing moves or resetting turns
* Trait - v2.3.0 - Library originally created by Lemonymous and updated to v2.3.0 to support multiple traits via appending text and cycling images

# Install
- If playing with World Builders:
	- Download the custom 1.2.1 version of memedit and unzip it (https://github.com/Redacted-Rice/memedit/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
	- Copy the current memedit folder or zip it (renaming won't work) at "Into the Breach\scripts\mod_loader\extensions\modLoaderExtensions\mods"
	- Replace the memedit folder in the unzippped version
		- Make sure there is not an extra layer of folder
- Unzip the release folder
- Place the unzipped RedactedRiceMods folder in "Into the Breach\mods" folder
  - Make sure there is not an extra layer of folder - when you enter the RedactedRiceMods folder you should see the "scripts" folder. Remove any extra folder layers

To uninstall, delete the folder in mods
