See individual folders for more details on each mod

# Squads
* Treeherders - v1.0.1 - Inspired by ents, this squad focuses on using forests tiles to increase their power. The flagship entborg mech gets stronger as the forests get destroyed
* WorldBuilders - v0.8.0 - This squad focuses on terrain manipulation to block and avoid damage. It has some strong single target effects but you can easily get overwhelmed by numbers if not strategically manipulating the terrain

# Libs
* PassiveEffect - v1.1.0 - Library to help with adding passive weapons to the game. This will handle automatically detecting if the weapon is powered and only call hooks when it is
* PredictableRandom - v1.1.0 - Library to get random numbers in a way that is repeatable for when undoing moves or resetting turns
