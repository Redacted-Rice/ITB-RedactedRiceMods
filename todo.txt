Tree Herders:
Final run through

Next release candidates:
1. Mechs (entborg specifically?) can never catch forest on fire? Might be too much a nerf on tree-venge
2. Make entborg a cyborg?
3. Forest fire burrow effect?
4. Treevac doesn't distinguish between damage in the attack that causes the push vs follow on attacks when checking for spaces to push to
5. Violent growth attack cancelled when attacking allies


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

World Builders:
VFX in general
Add projectile image(s) for consume
undoing turn with hover over pit results in falling...

Next release candidates:
Visual "bug" showing push damage when swap pushed with adjacent mountain or building. Not sure there is a way around this (bHide?)

Pilot/Custom Skills:
Not equals scans?
	If so we can determine pilot fairly relialby (Double pointers for some reason)
	Can then determine xp, level, name, id, etc
	But NOT skills
		Need to assume pointers and search for skill names at address to get skills
Get all heap memory?
	Add a few copies of pilot/weapon
	Can then search all memory for pilots and backtrace to hangar
Get base game pointer?	
	Can probably continue reverse engineering structure to get to hangar

Mech upgrades
	Actual value stored somewhere else for both but a read only value is in pawn. Instantly reset back to the stored value when changed
		Uses value 3 for distinct visual power - green power bar uses 2. Using a not scan would be more robust
		Can potentially be made a read only value
	GetHealth() & GetMoveSpeed() are updated right away and can get target value
	Can use SetMaxBaseHealth() and SetMoveSpeed() to undo changes (can set to negative values if needed)
