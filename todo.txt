General:

Tree Herders:
None

Next release candidates:
1. Treevac doesn't distinguish between damage in the attack that causes the push vs follow on attacks when checking for spaces to push to

Known issues:
Forest Firer bounce happens after push. Doesn't seem to be a way around this but its just visual anyways
Forest Firer teleport and launch SFX just sometimes don't play. Not sure why this is
Forest armor icon will sometimes appear when environment effects are occuring. I think this should be mostly fixed now but may show occasionally


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

World Builders:
1. Make and test unknown item image
2. Continue working on custom tile rules
	nautilus incenerator (memedit changes for get custom anim needed or maybe just don't worry about it)
	Unique building swapping not blocked currently... Not sure why but want to look into supporting this
3. Vanilla unique building swapping?
4. Investigate handling the destroy 2 mountains with consume
5. Consider upgrades for consume other than + range. 
	Maybe two click and consume 1 or 3 spaces? Seems like it could be powerful
		Or maybe easier to target different directions? (adj rows or cardinal directions with 90 consume?)

Next release candidates:
None

Known Issues:
1. Move range hovering does not display right. This is not currently able to be changed
2. When you move over a frozen tile, the ice will visually disappear but will still be there
3. When you use mold with acid, damage on second effect will show base damage on the space but will show right damage on pawn itself. This seems to be just related to how ItB handles damage and acid and throws
4. Add support for Farliner whirlpool swapping

MoreLvlUpSkills:
Working in separate branch


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PilotStore:
Planned out. To start work


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mech upgrades (to start in earnest):
	Actual value stored somewhere else for both but a read only value is in pawn. Instantly reset back to the stored value when changed
		Uses value 3 for distinct visual power - green power bar uses 2. Using a not scan would be more robust
		Can potentially be made a read only value
	GetHealth() & GetMoveSpeed() are updated right away and can get target value
	Can use SetMaxBaseHealth() and SetMoveSpeed() to undo changes (can set to negative values if needed)

Squad 3: Mini Expansion - Its still a secret ;)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Squad 4: Full on Expansion - Its also still a secret ;)

Libs:
Make libs global so things like getting active passives in passive weapon will working correctly
