General:
Test modpack integration

Tree Herders:
Review next release candidates

Test:
- Modpack integration

Next release candidates:
1. Mechs (entborg specifically?) can never catch forest on fire? Might be too much a nerf on tree-venge
2. Make entborg a cyborg?
3. violent growth choose spot to expand to?
4. Forest fire burrow effect?
5. Treevac doesn't distinguish between damage in the attack that causes the push vs follow on attacks when checking for spaces to push to
6. Violent growth attack cancelled when attacking allies


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

World Builders:
VFX in general
Add projectile image(s) for consume

Test:
- Modpack integration
- Passive weapon
- flying for movement passive

Next release candidates:
Visual "bug" showing push damage when swap pushed with adjacent mountain or building. Not sure there is a way around this (bHide?)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libs:
Passive effect doesn't show in test scenario
