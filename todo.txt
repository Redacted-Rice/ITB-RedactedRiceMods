General:
None


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tree Herders:
Playtest!

Next release candidates:
1. Treevac doesn't distinguish between damage in the attack that causes the push vs follow on attacks when checking for spaces to push to

Known issues:
Forest Firer bounce happens after push. Doesn't seem to be a way around this
Forest Firer teleport and launch SFX just sometimes don't play. Not sure why this is


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

World Builders:
None

Next release candidates:
1. Add icon for all terrain movement

Known Issues:
1. Move range hovering does not display right. This is not currently able to be changed
2. When you move over a frozen tile, the ice will visually disappear but will still be there
3. When you use mold with acid, damage on second effect will show base damage on the space but will show right damage on pawn itself. This seems to be just related to how ItB handles damage and acid and throws

Pilot/Custom Skills:
Not equals scans?
	If so we can determine pilot fairly relialby (Double pointers for some reason)
	Can then determine xp, level, name, id, etc
	But NOT skills
		Need to assume pointers and search for skill names at address to get skills
Get all heap memory?
	Add a few copies of pilot/weapon
	Can then search all memory for pilots and backtrace to hangar
Get base game pointer?	
	Can probably continue reverse engineering structure to get to hangar

Mech upgrades
	Actual value stored somewhere else for both but a read only value is in pawn. Instantly reset back to the stored value when changed
		Uses value 3 for distinct visual power - green power bar uses 2. Using a not scan would be more robust
		Can potentially be made a read only value
	GetHealth() & GetMoveSpeed() are updated right away and can get target value
	Can use SetMaxBaseHealth() and SetMoveSpeed() to undo changes (can set to negative values if needed)

Squad 3: Mini Expansion - Its still a secret ;)

Libs:
Make libs global so things like getting active passives in passive weapon will working correctly
