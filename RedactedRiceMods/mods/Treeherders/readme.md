## Known Issues
1. Forest Firer bounce happens after push. Doesn't seem to be a way around this but its just visual anyways
2. Forest Firer teleport and launch SFX just sometimes don't play. Not sure why this is
3. Forest armor icon will sometimes appear when environment effects are occuring. I think this should be mostly fixed now but may show occasionally
